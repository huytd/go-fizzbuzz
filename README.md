:rabbit: Learn to write testable fizzbuzz program in Golang

## The program
**FizzBuzz** is a toy program that has very simple rules: You give **FizzBuzz** a number and it will:

- Return **Fizz** if that number is a multiples of **3**
- Return **Buzz** if that number is a multiples of **5**
- Return **FizzBuzz** if that number is both multiples of **3** and **5**
- Otherwise, return **the number itself** 

It's not only very easy to implement, but also very clearly to write some tests.

## Unit testing - Meet the tools

## TDD approach - Write test first, the code can wait

## Write code first, test it later

## Changes are OK, and you can handle it

## Test coverage, how much coverage is enough?
